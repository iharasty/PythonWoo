	"<title>" : [
		...
	]
	
	Dictionaries are OBJECTS and accessed with key pairs

	}
	
	

----datetime----

	correct import statement
	seems to make it an object in the class?
	from datetime import datetime
	
	getting the time
	now = datetime.now()
	
	accessing a particular thing
		now.hour
		now.minute
		now.month
